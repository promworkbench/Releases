       <!-- If you need to add a dependency on a third-party library, make
            sure you copy the library to the lib folder at the end of the build.xml file. 
            Before you include such a dependency, please first check the following web page:
            http://ais-hudson.win.tue.nl:8080/view/System/job/Libs/lastBuild/console
            This page shows an overview of already existing third-party libraries, and by
            which package they are already included. Please add a dependency to this package
            if possible, as this will automatically include the library. This prevents us
            from having multiple different (possibly conflicting) versions of the same library.
