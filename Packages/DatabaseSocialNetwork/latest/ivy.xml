        <!-- Eric Verbeek, November 9, 2018:
        
             The following dependency on the GPLv2Utils package is a run-time dependency only. 
             It only guarantees that the GPLv2Utils package will be installed when the DatabaseSocialNetwork package is installed.
             As such, the GPLv2Utils package can be considered as a System Library to the DatabaseSocialNetwork package.
             Hence, the DatabaseSocialNetwork package is not required to use the GPL license of the GPLv2Utils package. 
             At least, this is how I understand it.
             
        -->
       <dependency org="prom" name="GPLv2Utils" rev="latest" changing="true" transitive="true" />
       <!-- Uncomment the next line if you need to use often-used GUI widgets. -->

       <!-- If you need to add a dependency on a third-party library, make
            sure you copy the library to the lib folder at the end of the build.xml file. 
            Before you include such a dependency, please first check the following web page:
            http://ais-hudson.win.tue.nl:8080/view/System/job/Libs/lastBuild/console
            This page shows an overview of already existing third-party libraries, and by
            which package they are already included. Please add a dependency to this package
            if possible, as this will automatically include the library. This prevents us
            from having multiple different (possibly conflicting) versions of the same library.
